"""
To create a class, you use the class keyword followed by the name of the class and a colon. Then within the class, 
you can add an initializer, along with any attributes and methods.
Attributes are like variables within a class, and are used to store data. Methods are functions defined within a class, 
and are the actions objects created with a class can perform.
